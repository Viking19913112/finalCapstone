Project Information:


In this project I had to update and improve a programme.
I had to follow the instructions given from .pdf file  (SE T17 - Capstone Project - Lists, Functions, and String Handlâ€¦)

The programme is a task manager. The user is asked to input information.
The user can edit tasks data.
All they need to do is create an account for each individual along with a password.

The user can view their own tasks and tasks that are still in need of completing.
The programme can also run statistic infomation and generate reports.(admin only)
