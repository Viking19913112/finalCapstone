>Project Information:


     In this project I had to update and improve a programme.
     I had to follow the instructions given from .pdf file  (SE T17 - Capstone Project - Lists, Functions, and String Handlâ€¦) The programme is a task manager. The user is asked to input information.
     The user can edit tasks data.
     All they need to do is create an account for each individual along with a password.
     The user can view their own tasks and tasks that are still in need of completing.
     The programme can also run statistic infomation and generate reports.(admin only)
